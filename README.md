Welcome to [Sustain Life](https://nameiswaiyinsin.github.io/sustainlife/) README.md ! 

## Brief
[Sustain Life](https://nameiswaiyinsin.github.io/sustainlife/) is a website for people who would like to live a more sustainable lifestyle through gaining information and inspiration about repairing, maintaining and being creative with their own belongings! They can also share and connect by submitting their own sustainability journeys and projects! 

The last number of years has seen a rise in communities finding ways to be more sustainable and be kinder to the earth by reducing comsumption and increasing the lifecycle of the products they already own. By learning to properly maintain, repair and repurpose your own belongings, you can prolong the lifecycle of your items and maximise its use before deteoriation and being disposed off which is much kinder to our environment. The aim of this website is to facilitate this learning by curating a video library of various topics to maintain, repair items and sustainable gifting etiquette, while aiming to be a fun and engaging for the audience. 

This site allows people to learn, connect and have fun with their sustainability journeys and projects!

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme I chose was inspired by earth's natural colours such as green, brown and charcoal in various shades. It reflects the natural, environmentally conscious theme of the website. Black and white were also used as standard colours to add clarity and familiarity for users.
